#What is a clinical trial?
#Clinical trials are widely recognized as a powerful and important design.  Evidence from
#well-designed clinical trials is almost always considered the strongest form of evidence, 
#so that clinical trials are at the top of a hierarchy of levels of evidence, followed by
#well designed cohort studies, case control studies, and ecological designs (a
#useful discussion is given in [Ho2008]).  

#In general, the goal of clinical studies, whether or observational
#or experimental, is to determine whether or not a treatment,
#intervention, or exposure is related to an outcome.  Such questions may
#take many forms, depending on the nature of the exposure or treatment, and the nature
#of the outcome.  Here is a sample of observational or experimental studies, taken
#almost at random from the literature.
# Is cigarette smoking associated with uveitis? (e.g. [Lin2010]).
# Is prenatal exposure to influenza associated with adult schizophrenia? (e.g. [Ebert2005])
# Are chili peppers associated with increased risk of stomach cancer? (e.g. [LopezCarillo1994])
# Does streptomycin treat tuberculosis? (e.g. [BMRC1948])
# Does hormone replacement therapy help prevent coronary heart disease? (e.g. [Hulley1998])
# Does topiramate help reduce the frequency of migraine? Acupuncture? (e.g. [Silberstein2009,Li2012])
# Does vitamin A supplementation reduce hearing loss in African children? (e.g. [Schmitz2012])
# Does circumcision reduce HIV incidence in men? (e.g. [Gray2007])
# Does intercessory prayer influence recovery from illness? (e.g. [Benson2006], a study funded by
#a religious foundation)
#In some of these, we are interested in a binary (yes/no) outcome, such as the occurrence of stomach cancer.  In others,
#we are interested in an event rate (such as the frequency of migraine), a continuous variable (hearing loss), or a 
#possibly censored event time (time to HIV infection).  

#Friedman et al. [Friedman1998] define a clinical trial as a prospective study comparing the effect of
#an intervention against a control in humans.  The key features are
# A clinical trial is prospective, so that the assignment is made and then the patients are followed forward in time.
# A clinical trial has a control group.
# A clinical trial is an experiment.
# Clinical trials are governed by ethical principles, and therefore differ from experimental studies in
#other fields where patient safety is not a factor.

#While some of these questions were suitable for a clinical trial, some questions of interest cannot be studied
#experimentally.  In some cases, the exposure of interest is
#known to cause other health problems, and cannot be experimentally administered (cigarette smoking), or the outcome
#is so severe that it would be unthinkable to do an experiment (schizophrenia).  In some cases, a clinical trial may
#simply be impractical because of adherence, while in others, the rationale for a clinical trial is 
#dubious on subject matter grounds (e.g., it is unclear on a priori grounds whether or not prayer is
#an appropriate subject for a clinical trial).

#What can clinical trials do that other designs cannot?
#Clinical trials permit causal inference.  By experimentally manipulating the exposure, confounding is (in a 
#probabilistic sense) eliminated.  Moreover, good clinical trial protocols minimize bias by using masked
#patients and investigators.  Masking and randomization are the twin cornerstones of clinical trial design.

#Why is masking important?
#Masking, also called  blinding, removes an important source of bias.  For example, consider a trial of
#whether or not acupuncture prevents migraine.  Patients or investigators may have a prior commitment to acupuncture,
#which is a low-tech traditional intervention.  Belief in the efficacy of the intervention may lead people to 
#inadvertently understate the frequency of migraine if the patients know they received acupuncture.  This bias may
#lead people to believe in the efficacy of the intervention.

#When both the
#subjects and investigators are masked, the trial is {\it double masked} (also called
# double blind).  

#In certain trials, masking is impossible.  For example, in a trial of a surgical procedure, it
#is impossible to mask the surgeon, and frequently impossible to mask the patients (it would be impossible
#for a patient randomized to radical prostatectomy vs external beam radiation to be masked).  Another
#example arises in dietary interventions: it would be impossible to be masked to whether or not one had
#been randomized to a low carbohydrate vs a low fat arm (for example).
#In such circumstances, it may still be possible to use biomedical measurements made by masked personnel, so that
#the inference could be based on objective measurements made by masked personnel.

#Unmasked trials are viewed as less credible than masked trials, because of bias.  Therefore, both subjects 
#and investigators should be masked whenever possible.  When evaluating a published clinical trial, be aware of
#subtle ways in which masking could have been compromised.  For instance, patients may be aware of side effects of
#the medication, or the medications may be different in some subtle way detectable to trained physicians.

#Why is randomization important?
#Randomization insures that unknown factors will be balanced in the study arms, in a probabilistic sense.  The 
#development of randomized experimental designs by R. A. Fisher early in the last century arguably inaugurated the modern
#era of biomedical research.

#Armitage [Armitage1982] gives three important reasons for randomization.  First, randomization achieves broad similarity
#between the treatment and control groups, with respect to known and unknown prognostic factors; it is unlikely that a
#serious imbalance will occur by chance alone.  
#Second, statistical theory (which RA Fisher played a prominent role
#in developing) may be used to compute the chance that a difference between the treatment and control groups was due to 
#chance alone.  Third, randomization supports masking; using any nonrandom method for allocation makes it harder to maintain masking.
#Yoshioka [Yoshioka1998] gives the following example from the MRC Streptomycin trial: ``using allotment by alternation, the
#clinicians would be certain that the next patient to be admitted would, say, receive the treatment, and their decision
#whether to accept this patient might consequently be affected.''  Yoshioka goes on to give a fourth reason in support of
#randomization in a clinical trial: fairness in allocation.

#%In Exercise 1, we will simulate a clinical trial.  Suppose that recovery from tuberculosis is governed by an unknown
#%individual factor, something we cannot measure.  Assume that the probability of recovery is 18/107, taken from 
#%both arms of the MRC tuberculosis trial of 1948.  Simulate a clinical trial in which 55 patients (110 in total) are assigned 
#%to a treatment or a control group, supposing that the intervention does not work.  

#Why is a control group important?
#Without a control group, we do not know what would have happened without the treatment, and therefore cannot estimate
#the effect of the treatment.  The control group may be a masked placebo, or in some cases may be an existing standard of
#care to which a new intervention is being compared.

#When is a clinical trial needed?
#Although a clinical trial provides the highest form of evidence, the expense of a clinical 
#trial implies that a clinical trial should only done when the question is of sufficient importance
#to warrant a trial.  

#Equipoise is indicated prior to beginning a clinical trial.  There must be genuine disagreement as to
#the value of the therapy.  For instance, topical application of the antifungal _natamycin_ is commonly
#used for fungal infections of the cornea, although no controlled clinical trial ever established this.  The reason
#is that it seems better on _a priori_ grounds to use an antifungal agent to treat a fungal infection
#than to offer no treatment to the patient.

#What are some common clinical trial designs?
#What is a factorial design?
#A factorial design assigns study units to all combinations of experimental factors.  In the Mycotic Ulcer 
#Therapeutic Exploratory Trial, the investigators were interested in drugs and in corneal scraping.  Two drugs were
#of interest (natamycin and voriconazole, making two levels of this factor), and two scraping protocols (either
#actually scrape, or don't scrape, making two levels of this factor).  A $2 \times 2$ factorial design was conducted.

#What is a noninferiority trial?
#In some cases, we are interested in a new drug for which there is already an accepted drug or treatment.  It is
#unethical to withhold treatment, so that ethical considerations preclude the presence of a placebo control.  In this case, we
#wish to test the hypothesis that the new drug is not worse than the old drug.

#What is a group-randomized trial?
#In some cases, the natural intervention unit is not the individual, but the group or community.

#How can one analyze data from a simple trial?
#Statistical analysis of clinical trial data depends on the nature of the outcome variable and the
#trial design.  In the examples below, we will illustrate analysis using data from the 
#Mycotic Ulcer Therapeutic Exploratory Trial, a $2 \times 2$ factorial trial in which
#the drug  azithromycin was compared to natamycin, and corneal scraping was compared to
#no corneal scraping.  The trial was conducted by investigators from UCSF and Aravind Eye Hospital, 
#India (Lietman, Acharya, Srinivasan) in 2008.

#Warmup Exercises
#Normal random variables
#How can we simulate data from a standard normal distribution with a given mean and standard deviation?
#To simulate a given number of random variates, use the {\tt rnorm} command.  Here, we simulate 100 
#standard normal variates with a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 3:

v1 <- rnorm(100,mean=10,sd=3)
hist(v1)

#Simulate 30 variates with a mean of 1 and a standard deviation of 0.3.  Repeat this exercise 10 times, 
#plotting the histogram each time.
# Describe what you find

#Random selection
#How can we simulate random selection of people into a treatment and a control group?  To do so,
#we use sampling without replacement based on the `sample` command.  Here, we divide 20 subjects
#into a treatment group and a control group.  We select without replacement half of the numbers from
#1 to 20 (representing the people) into a treatment and a control group.

indices <- 1:20
treatment.group <- sample(indices,size=10,replace=FALSE)
treatment.group

#Repeat this exercise a few times.

#Another way to do it is to simply shuffle a vector of 0s and 1s.  

assignments <- sample( c(rep(1,10),rep(0,10)), size=20, replace=FALSE )
assignments


#The assignment of the first person is found by looking at  assignments[1], the second person
#by looking at  assignments[2], and so on.  Assume that 1 corresponds to the treatment group.
#We can print the number of the treatment subjects like this:


which(assignments==1)



#Working with data frames
#We will now generate a simulated data set.   Here, we assume the treatment and control groups 
#do not differ statistically---the mean and standard deviation of the outcome variable are assumed
#to be the same.


n.subjects <- 20
dset <- data.frame(study.id=1:n.subjects)
dset$treatment <- sample( c(rep(1,n.subjects/2),rep(0,n.subjects/2)), size=n.subjects, replace=FALSE )
dset$outcome <- rnorm(n.subjects, mean=1,sd=0.3)
dset




rm(dset,n.subjects,assignments)


#Understanding Type I Error
#In this section, we will simulate a clinical trial in which the treatment does not work.  To make
#this easy, we are going to first write a function that generates the data set.  


gen.data <- function(n.subjects, control.mean, treatment.effect, sd) {
  dset <- data.frame(study.id = 1:n.subjects)
  dset$treatment <- sample( c(rep(1,n.subjects/2),rep(0,n.subjects/2)), size=n.subjects, replace=FALSE )
  mean.vector <- ifelse(dset$treatment==1, control.mean+treatment.effect, control.mean)
  dset$outcome <- rnorm(n.subjects, mean=mean.vector, sd=sd)
  dset
}



#Exercise: use this function to generate a data set of size 20, with a treatment effect of 0, and a 
#mean of 1.  Assume the standard deviation is 0.3.


v1 <- gen.data(20, 1, 0, 0.3)
v1



#Exercise: conduct a T-test of the difference between the treatment and control groups.


t.test(outcome ~ treatment, data=v1)


#What do you find?  Try it a few times---generate new data, and repeat the test.  Keep doing this until
#you find $P<0.05$.  How long did it take?  When $P<0.05$, we reject the null hypothesis at a
#significance level of 0.05.

#Exercise: repeat this 10,000 times.  Let's build a function to do this:


repeat.test <- function(nsims, n.subjects, control.mean, treatment.effect, sd) {
  ans <- rep(NA, nsims)
  for (ii in 1:nsims) {
    v1 <- gen.data(n.subjects, control.mean, treatment.effect, sd)
    ans[ii] <- t.test(outcome ~ treatment, data=v1)$p.value
  }
  ans
}
a1 <- repeat.test(10000,20,1,0,0.3)


#Let's find out how often we reject:


mean(a1 < 0.05)


#(Why does this command work?)

#Try this experiment again.

#Now try it with a sample size of--not 20---but 100.  Repeat for 200 and 500.  How does the rejection
#probability change with the sample size?

#\subsection*{Power}
#Now, suppose the treatment does work.  Suppose that the difference between the treatment group and
#the control group is 0.15, which turns out to be one and one half lines of vision on a traditional
#chart.  


a2 <- repeat.test(10000, 20, 1, -0.15, 0.3)
mean(a2 < 0.05)


#How often do you reject for a sample size of 20?  Try it for 50, 100, 200, and 500.  Can you find the
#sample size so that you reject 80\% of the time (approximately)?  The probability of rejecting the
#null hypothesis when you should reject it is called the power, and it does depend on the sample size.

#Now, suppose the treatment effect is very small, only 0.025:

a3 <- repeat.test(10000, 100, 1, -0.025, 0.3)
mean(a3 < 0.05)


#For a sample size of 100, how often do you reject?  For a given sample size, how does the chance of
#rejecting the null hypothesis depend on the effect?  As you lower the treatment effect, the power goes
#up or down?

#Inference
#An important advantage of the clinical trial is that it (probabilistically) controls for confounding.  
#Randomization allocates potential confounders to the two arms with equal probability.  Let's do an
#example.  Suppose that 10\% of infected individuals have an infection by an organism that is harder to
#cure and leads to worse outcomes.  However, suppose that we don't know this at the time of enrollment
#or treatment.  Let's simulate the trial.  First, let's write a new data generation function that will
#add the simulated covariate.  Here we assume that patients with the severe organism have acuity that
#is {\tt severe.effect} worse (and default of 0.4).

gen.data.ii <- function(n.subjects, control.mean, treatment.effect, sd, severe.prob, severe.effect=0.4) {
  dset <- data.frame(study.id = 1:n.subjects)
  dset$treatment <- sample( c(rep(1,n.subjects/2),rep(0,n.subjects/2)), size=n.subjects, replace=FALSE )
  dset$severe <- rbinom(n.subjects, size=1, prob=severe.prob)
  mean.vector <- ifelse(dset$treatment==1, control.mean+treatment.effect, control.mean)
  dset$outcome <- rnorm(n.subjects, mean=mean.vector, sd=sd) + severe.effect * dset$severe
  dset
}
simdata <- gen.data.ii(20, 1.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.1, 0.4)
simdata

#Let's simulate a modest clinical trial (say 50 individuals in each arm, 100 total) and see how well the severe cases are
#balanced:

simdata <- gen.data.ii(100, 1.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.1, 0.4)
table(simdata$treatment, simdata$severe)

#What does this mean?  Repeat this several times.  

#Let's repeat the simulated trial several times under these circumstances.

repeat.test.ii <- function(nsims, n.subjects, control.mean, treatment.effect, sd, prob.severe, severe.effect) {
  ans <- rep(NA, nsims)
  for (ii in 1:nsims) {
    v1 <- gen.data.ii(n.subjects, control.mean, treatment.effect, sd, prob.severe, severe.effect)
    ans[ii] <- t.test(outcome ~ treatment, data=v1)$p.value
  }
  ans
}

#Use this function to determine how the clinical trial works even though there is an unknown covariate that
#has a substantial effect on the outcome.

#Optional exercise: modify the original {\tt repeat.test} so that it takes a data-generating function as an
#argument, instead of rewriting the function as we just did.  What is a graceful way to handle additional
#arguments required by the data generating function?  (Suggestion: ``rest'' argument {\tt ...} might work.)

#Exploring some clinical trial data
#We will examine data from the Mycotic Ulcer Therapeutic Exploratory Trial.  These data can only be used for this lab.  To
#protect confidentiality, I added a tiny random value to some of the scar values from the actual trial.

load("MuTxT.Rdata")

#The variables are:
#"patid"           -- patient ID
#"drug"            -- drug assignment: 0 is natamycin, 1 is voriconazole 
#"scrape"          -- scraping: 0 is no, 1 is yes
#"age"             -- age
#"sex"             -- sex
#"if_perf"         -- 1 if a perforation happened
#"scar_baseline"   -- scar size at baseline
#"scar_3W"         -- scar size at 3 weeks

#Try to estimate the treatment effect on scar size at 3 weeks.  Consider controlling for baseline.  Is it necessary to
#control for a covariate?  Why might one do so?
#Example:
summary(lm(scar_3W ~ drug + scrape, data=mutxt))
