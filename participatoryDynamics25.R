## You should probably use a better-supported work flow than mine (JD)
## But there are things you can learn from it:
#### Run your code frequently from the beginning in a clean environment
###### In rstudio you can do this with shortcuts for Session/restart_R
###### and Code/Region/Run_all (recommend to learn keyboard shortcuts)
#### Break long flows into files to allow you to save your state in an externally viewable, stable form
#### and to mix and match steps, easily control what you want to run when

print("Hi!")
