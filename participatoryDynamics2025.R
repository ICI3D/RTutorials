## You should probably use a better-supported work flow than mine (JD)
## But there are things you can learn from it:
#### Run your code frequently from the beginning in a clean environment
###### In rstudio you can do this with shortcuts for Session/restart_R
###### and Code/Region/Run_all (recommend to learn keyboard shortcuts)
#### Break long flows into files to allow you to save your state in an externally viewable, stable form
#### and to mix and match steps, easily control what you want to run when

## State variables: S, E, I, V
## Processes: Infection, mortality (two kinds), birth, waning immunity, vaccination, progression
## Parameters
## beta, mu_b, mu_d, gamma (progression rate), eps (waning rate)
## tau (vacc rate), b (birth flow)
## We will use lam for force of infection

## What are some things we're worried about leaving out?
## Other interventions, like sterilization
## Heterogeneity (maybe let beta decline with prevalence)
## Whether beta is changing with N (beta should decrease if N crashes)
## Immigration
