## This is the brainstorm area, aim to remove it by early in the clinic

## This is intended as a replacement for Lab 1
#### ICI3D_Lab1_ODEmodels.R

## Make an SIR object
## simulate and plot discrete-time trajectories

## Plot

## Other implementations
#### ODE
#### Whatever Steve is calling the discrete-time demographic stochastic
#### Is there even Gillespie?

## Extensions
#### Birth-death
#### latent compartment
#### Be creative

## The goal of this tutorial is to acquaint you with ways of
## implementing simple infectious disease models in R using macpan2
## this tutorial, you should be able to:

##  Create a model object in macpan2
##  Run simulations
##  Plot simulation outputs

## You should already have installed macpan2
## If not, please do it (see https://canmod.github.io/macpan2/#installation)
