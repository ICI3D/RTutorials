## Do existing COVID vaccines protect against the lambda variant?
## WHAT is our outcome variable? Severe disease.
## There are many other possibilities.
#### Deaths 

## How can we approach this question?
## What kind of study should we do?

## Post-vaccination surveillance
## Observational study: who was vaccinated what's the outcome?
## Randomized controlled trial: 
#### Advantage: balances all possible confounders (?)
#### Disadvantage: unethical

## Single-arm trial: simply give the vaccine and observe
#### Disadvantage: No direct comparison
#### Advantage: Allows you to vaccinate more people avoid ethical problems
## No-control trial: compare different vaccines

## Observational study
#### Vaccination status
#### Severe illness
#### Age 
#### co-morbidity
#### occupation

## We are going to assume transmission is exogenous (comes from outside)
## for the purpose of this exercise
