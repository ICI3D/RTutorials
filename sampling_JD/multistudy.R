## Can we confirm that PreP prevents acquisition of HIV in a certain population?

## Recruit HIV-negative persons at risk and randomize them to different treatment groups
## e.g., female sex workers, MSM, people in a partnership with a positive person

## For now, we assume that one of the treatments is effective a placebo (no effect), but this has ethical concerns, so we may come back and try a comparative study instead

## Units trick!
## We can talk about this later, or feel free to ignore it
