### Our rabies modeling shows that we expect rabies vaccination to reduce rabies rates even among unvaccinated dogs

### We will think about how to design a trial that could test this assumption

### We will do some simulated trials in our model world to see:
#### Whether the test is valid (i.e., can we properly control the false-positive rate)
#### Whether the test is powerful (i.e., if our assumptions are right, do we expect it to work
